üõ°Ô∏è Email and SMS Spam Detection: Enhancing Communication Security with Machine Learning
Unwanted spam messages clutter our inboxes and pose significant security risks. To combat this, I developed a spam detection system that leverages machine learning and an intuitive Streamlit web application, ensuring both accuracy and accessibility.

üåü Key Achievements:
High Performance:
Using the spam.csv dataset, I implemented advanced NLP techniques such as:
TfidfVectorizer for text feature extraction.
Multinomial Naive Bayes for robust classification.
Achieved an impressive 97% accuracy rate and a perfect precision score of 1.0, ensuring reliable spam detection.

User-Friendly Deployment with Streamlit:
Deployed the model as a Streamlit web application, providing users with an intuitive platform to classify messages as spam or legitimate in real-time.
This deployment makes the system accessible for individuals and organizations, fostering a safer and clutter-free digital environment.

üí° Future Prospects:
Expanding the system to include multi-language support for broader applicability.
Adding features like real-time email integration or bulk message analysis for enterprise use.
Exploring explainable AI techniques (e.g., SHAP) to improve user trust by showing why a message is classified as spam.
